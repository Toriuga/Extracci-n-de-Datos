In my spare time, I enjoy going on the many fantastic hikes in HK, sipping bubble tea and cold beer on the beach, yoga, jazz, good coffee and a good book.

When I travel abroad I always use Airbnb. For me, a clean, comfortable and safe place to stay is essential. This is exactly what I offer to any guests staying with me. I hope that my place will be a little home-away-from-home for you during your time in HK.

FAQ: When do I pay for my long-term reservation?
www.airbnb.com/help/question/245

Due to the reason that Sep-Apr is peak season, you are advised to make your reservation earlier.   I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't cancel guest booking so far, except from time to time having guest need to cancel or amend their booking due to different reason and we will considerate case by case (so far only full refund to 1 group of guest as they are able to provide document to proof that their immediate family member need emergency operation). 

Max Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.


Contact Number and Email Information will only be released until a booking is made. 

Below is the FAQ on airbnb “Why can’t I call or email a host before booking?”: www.airbnb.com/help/question/111

FAQ: When do I pay for my long-term reservation?
www.airbnb.com/help/question/245

Due to the reason that Sep-Apr is peak season, you are advised to make your reservation earlier.   I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't cancel guest booking so far, except from time to time having guest need to cancel or amend their booking due to different reason and we will considerate case by case (so far only full refund to 1 group of guest as they are able to provide document to proof that their immediate family member need emergency operation). 

Max Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.


Contact Number and Email Information will only be released until a booking is made. 

Below is the FAQ on airbnb “Why can’t I call or email a host before booking?”: www.airbnb.com/help/question/111

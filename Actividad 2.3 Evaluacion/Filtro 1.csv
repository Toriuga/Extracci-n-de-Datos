my Wife and I have this little apartment for friends and family which we let to travelers to Hong Kong when its free.  

We like to look after people and ensure that they enjoy their stay in Hong Kong.  We have someone who will visit every other day to keep the place clean and tidy.  

We can arrange travel cards, maps and local SIMs for you upon arrival if you need and will meet you at the door or provide a self check in option depending on your needs.

We will be available on the phone during your stay to help with whatever you need and make sure that you enjoy your stay.  If you need an unlocked phone for your stay we are happy to lend you one.

The apartment is 5 minutes walk from Soho and the Elevator and it puts you right in the middle of the main bar/restaurant area of Hong Kong Island.  You will not want to spend much time in the apartment as everything is so close by.  However, for those days when you just want to sit and relax though we have a pile of DVDs and can lend you a few games if you need.

And, if you are a sailor, we are members of the RHKYC and can make some introductions if you want.

hope to see you in Hong Kong soon.

Hi，我是Selena來自HK！旅行、美食、電影、音樂都是我生活的點點滴滴。每到一座陌生的城市，走街串巷，逛逛當地的菜市場，鉆鉆當地的小巷子，吃吃路邊攤，逛逛自由市場，才能真正體驗當地人的生活，不虛此行！另外，去一些很少人知道的或者交通不那麽方便的地方玩一玩，會有完全不一樣的體驗和收穫。我喜歡結交來自世界各地的朋友。Airbnb提供給了我一個很好的平台和機會。我個人有一些相當不錯的空房,我希望能提供給更多Airbnb的旅客,也希望每個人留在我們這裏都是非常愉快和舒服的。當然啦，Selena的旅店是以結交來自世界各地朋友爲目的的平價旅店，成長路上難免有不足之處，望多一份溝通少一份誤解，Selena非常期待您和您的朋友光臨！

Hi，我是Selena來自HK！旅行、美食、電影、音樂都是我生活的點點滴滴。每到一座陌生的城市，走街串巷，逛逛當地的菜市場，鉆鉆當地的小巷子，吃吃路邊攤，逛逛自由市場，才能真正體驗當地人的生活，不虛此行！另外，去一些很少人知道的或者交通不那麽方便的地方玩一玩，會有完全不一樣的體驗和收穫。我喜歡結交來自世界各地的朋友。Airbnb提供給了我一個很好的平台和機會。我個人有一些相當不錯的空房,我希望能提供給更多Airbnb的旅客,也希望每個人留在我們這裏都是非常愉快和舒服的。當然啦，Selena的旅店是以結交來自世界各地朋友爲目的的平價旅店，成長路上難免有不足之處，望多一份溝通少一份誤解，Selena非常期待您和您的朋友光臨！

Hi，我是Selena來自HK！旅行、美食、電影、音樂都是我生活的點點滴滴。每到一座陌生的城市，走街串巷，逛逛當地的菜市場，鉆鉆當地的小巷子，吃吃路邊攤，逛逛自由市場，才能真正體驗當地人的生活，不虛此行！另外，去一些很少人知道的或者交通不那麽方便的地方玩一玩，會有完全不一樣的體驗和收穫。我喜歡結交來自世界各地的朋友。Airbnb提供給了我一個很好的平台和機會。我個人有一些相當不錯的空房,我希望能提供給更多Airbnb的旅客,也希望每個人留在我們這裏都是非常愉快和舒服的。當然啦，Selena的旅店是以結交來自世界各地朋友爲目的的平價旅店，成長路上難免有不足之處，望多一份溝通少一份誤解，Selena非常期待您和您的朋友光臨！

各位小夥伴們.大家好.
我是Jean.
雖然我剛來airbnb不久.但我們的房源此前已有在各大網站售賣.
精緻典雅.溫馨裝潢.乾淨舒適的房間讓您在喧囂的城市中放慢腳步.恣意享受屬於自己的城市空間.
位於著名的弥敦道贯穿其中,这里是香港人气最旺盛的地区之一,潮流时尚.传统文化.市井风貌.小吃美食都汇集于此,全区繁华拥挤,不少商铺食肆通宵营业,故被称为是九龙的“不夜天”.

Hi，我是Selena來自HK！旅行、美食、電影、音樂都是我生活的點點滴滴。每到一座陌生的城市，走街串巷，逛逛當地的菜市場，鉆鉆當地的小巷子，吃吃路邊攤，逛逛自由市場，才能真正體驗當地人的生活，不虛此行！另外，去一些很少人知道的或者交通不那麽方便的地方玩一玩，會有完全不一樣的體驗和收穫。我喜歡結交來自世界各地的朋友。Airbnb提供給了我一個很好的平台和機會。我個人有一些相當不錯的空房,我希望能提供給更多Airbnb的旅客,也希望每個人留在我們這裏都是非常愉快和舒服的。當然啦，Selena的旅店是以結交來自世界各地朋友爲目的的平價旅店，成長路上難免有不足之處，望多一份溝通少一份誤解，Selena非常期待您和您的朋友光臨！
